This is a boilerplate for starting projects!

Includes support for
-Jquery (Javascript framework)
-Less (CSS pre-compiler)
-Modernizr (capability detection)
-Mustache (templating language)


Requires (for building)
-Node
-NPM


Just clone the repo and run ./init.sh
This will remove the git files (since you are starting a new project) 
It also removes the "init.sh" for safety reasons

Setup a vhost pointing to the public folder and you are good to go!


To build for production (or just to test how quick things will download) set the $dev variable to false at the top of index.php.
Then, in terminal run "gulp".

This will compile all your js/less/img files into the build directory - compressing everything

I WILL make this readme prettier later...

Thanks for trying!
